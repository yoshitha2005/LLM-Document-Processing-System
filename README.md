# LLM Document Processing System

## Project Description

This project is a web application that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to process and analyze documents. It is designed to intelligently handle tasks like insurance claims and policy processing by extracting key information, applying business rules, and providing structured outputs. The system allows users to upload documents and then submit natural language queries, which the AI processes to find relevant information and generate a justified decision.

The application is built with the following technologies:
* **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
* **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **shadcn-ui**: A collection of reusable components for building beautiful UIs.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
